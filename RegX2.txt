-->
	match what you want and only that 

	literal char "cat"

	meta character -->
		wildcard = . 
		escape =  \ (literal character never escaped)
		\t,\n,r\

	charset -->
		[] = these are the only that can match 
		- = only metachar if inside. needs start to end 
			[50-99] no meaning 
		^ = work as bang 
		
		metachar meaning lost there value inside charset
		\d,\w,\s,\D,\W,\S just shorthand like \s = [\n\t\r]

	repetition  -->

		* 
		+
		?
		{min=0,max=optional;,}
		greedy expression (bydefault greddy and eager)
		lazy expression ?
		efficiency : 
			-use + instead of * make it efficient even better {5}
			-be as specific as possible


			
	grouping metachar:
		
		()
		| (put the more efficient first because(abc|xyz) will match (xyz if comes first))

	anchored expression 
		^ = begin from start only 
		$ = end of str only 
		/b = word boundary --> really boost performance 
		/B = not word boundary

		bydefault single line mode
		you need to turn on mutiline mode


	capture group and back reference 	
		remember data(not expression) inside ()
		\1--\9
